## General Description
Assignment 1: Implementation of Backpropagation from scratch and Training a Palindrome Network
Check if 10-bit string is palindrome or not
Let’s take example of 10 bit string:
“1000000000” : Not Palindrome
“1000110001” : Palindrome
“0000000000” : Palindrome
“0101010101” : Not Palindrome
So I have generated all the possible combinations of 10 bit string from only [0,1]
Technique to be used: Neural network (BP from scratch using only numpy and pandas (without any external libraries))

#### Required Python Version : 3.9.7

## Setup
